# Adaptive MIDI tuner

This is the *adaptuner*: It *tunes* MIDI instruments on the fly, *adapt*ing to
what you're playing right now. [Here](https://adaptuner.carlhammann.com) is its
homepage.

The adaptuner is currently under heavy development. However, it is already
reasonably usable as an instrument.
