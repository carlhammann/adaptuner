# Adaptuner -- adaptive MIDI tuning

This is the *adaptuner*: It *tunes* MIDI instruments on the fly, *adapt*ing to
what you're playing right now. It gives anyone with an e-piano that has MIDI
input and output the opportunity to play music in real-time adaptive tunings,
in particular in (controlled deviations from) just intonation.

The ultimate goal of this project to become a usable instrument that enables
deliberately tweaking intonation as an expressive means. Rather than trying to
implement one "always correct" intonation logic -- which can't exist, because
it's ultimately a question of taste -- I want to make intonation intuitively
malleable, so that it becomes easy to try different approaches to tuning the
same piece of music.

The adaptuner is currently under heavy development. Therefore, documentation is
(for now) scarce. Have a look at this video to get a feel for where we're going:

## Obtaining the program

There are instructions at the [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/carlhammann/adaptuner). Currently, pre-compiled
binaries exist for

- x86_64 Linux (both as a raw binary that should run on many distributions, and
  as a `.deb` package),
- Apple Silicon Macs, and
- Microsoft Windows.

Please send your feedback and ideas! Also, if you want to use the adaptuner to
make music (for example with your choir), I'll be very happy to assist you in
figuring out how to make use of it for your specific needs.
