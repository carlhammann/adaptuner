title: Installing Adaptuner on Debian-based distributions
---

Currently, there's only a package for x86_64 processors. If you have a
different processor architecture, please contact me, and I'll see what I can
do.

1. Download and unpack `adaptuner-deb-x86_64-linux.zip` from the
   [release](https://github.com/carlhammann/adaptuner/releases) of your liking.
2. Install the contained `.deb` package as you normally do, e.g. with `sudo
   dpkg -i ...`.

Please report any problems either as GitHub issues or in an e-Mail to
`adaptuner AT carlhammann DOT com`.
