# General

- forbid looping MIDI connections
- handle the other two pedals correctly
  - treat ChannelVoice Messages in the backend, tweak PedalHold...?
- I just learned that Rust logical operators have short-circuiting variants. Use them!

# UI 

- coordination of zoom and scroll
- flattening the grid layout to increase space for keyboard
- multi-touch keyboard
- hande DetunedNote messages
- "really delete" should disappear upon closing the strategy selection popup
